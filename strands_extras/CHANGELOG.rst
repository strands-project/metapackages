Changelog for package strands_extras
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.0.10 (2015-01-27)
-------------------
* Adding a strands_extras metapackage
  Currently this only contains strands_qsr_lib but since this did not feel like being part of a base system, I created this extras package which might become more populated and some of the packages from base could maybe moved here as well.
